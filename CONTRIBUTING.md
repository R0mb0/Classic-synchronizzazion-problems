## Contributing code/Pull-Request

The community welcomes contribution, this can be done by starting a pull-request.
You can contribute by updating the package content or styling, code (
.cls file), or both.

### Contributing content or styling

There is a couple of basic requirement for us to merge the pull request:

- The styling should maintain the compatibility with previous versions.
 For example, if you plan to add a new number to the contact information,
 it should be optional and not mandatory allowing not to change anything
 to the other users of the package.

### Contributing code

If the change is big, typically if the change span to more than one file,
 consider starting an issue first to discuss the improvement.
 This will makes it much easier to make the change fit well into the package.

There is some basic requirement for us to merge a pull request:

- Describe the change
- Refer to any issues it effects
- Separate one pull request per functionality: if you start writing "and"
 in the feature description consider if it could be separated in two pull requests.

In your code:

- Make sure the coding style of your code follows the style of the file.
